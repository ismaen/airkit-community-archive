<p>I was looking for a way to bold the first sentence in a paragraph.  Essential creating a header title within the paragraph.  Also there might be need to bold something mid-paragraph.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from lorem ipsum</p>
<p><strong>Lorem ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@jeff_groupwork</span>, at the moment, the best way to do this is to use multiple labels and position them accordingly next to each other in order to bold something within a sentence. This is a good feature request though!</p>
