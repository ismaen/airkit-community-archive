<p>Question:<br/>
What is the purpose of using Custom Types Object?</p>
<p>Using an AppObject I can build out the object exactly the same as custom types object but I have the additional ability to reference the second AppObject and add it directly to initial AppObject Table.</p>
<p>Within the AppObject there is no way to reference the Custom Type Object that has been created like reference another AppObject.  I know I can use the Custom type Object and send data acquired with the Custom Type Object variable in a JSON as a text.</p>
<p>Is the sole purpose of the Custom Type Object is to build it as a variable only rather than have empty AppObjects which have the similar variable structure?</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@jeff_groupwork</span>! Your understanding of Custom Types vs Airdata App objects is spot on. Custom types are great for structuring the schema of an object to be used as a local variable, where as Airdata App objects can additionally be used to store data as well. Another use of custom types is that you can create a custom type from connection builder, for example as a result of an HTTP request which can help quickly build out the schema for your object.</p>
