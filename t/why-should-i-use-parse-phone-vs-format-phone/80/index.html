<p>Looking at the docs for PARSE_PHONE and FORMAT_PHONE, it looks like they can both achieve the same mission. Why should I use one vs the other?</p>

<p>This is an interesting question!</p>
<p><a href="https://support.airkit.com/reference/parse_phone">PARSE_PHONE</a> and <a href="https://support.airkit.com/reference/format_phone">FORMAT_PHONE</a> are subtly different. Crucially, PARSE_PHONE <em>always</em> returns input that counts as a <a href="https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-phone-variable-data-type">Phone Data Type</a>, whereas FORMAT_PHONE does not.</p>
<p>You can think of PARSE_PHONE as a function that makes phone number easily-readable for computers, while FORMAT_PHONE is a function that make phone numbers easily-readable for people.</p>
<p>A common use case for PARSE_PHONE is to take a phone number entered by an app user (which might use local formatting conventions and lack details like the country code) and ensure that it gets saved in a format that can be used to automatically send texts and phone calls (which requires a standardized format that encompasses details like the country code).</p>
<p>A common use case for FORMAT_PHONE is to take a phone number collected from an incoming call (and automatically saved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164">E.164</a> format) and return a string that formats the phone number according to local standards. Using local formatting conventions makes it easier for humans to read, even though the lack of standardization makes it a pain for computers to parse.</p>
<p>The format of the output of FORMAT_PHONE can vary, because it can return phone number formatted according to different specifications – including E.164. In practice, this means that there is some overlap in what PARSE_PHONE and FORMAT_PHONE can do, but they’re ultimately optimized for different use cases.</p>
